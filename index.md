### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was probably the most difficult lab in my opinion. The constant need of applying a variety of different concepts throughout the lab made it much more difficult than expected. Especially creating nested statements, as well as creating a lot of “or” “and” statements throughout the lab. However, I enjoyed the fact that these concepts can be applied in a scenario we see daily. And although, it was rather tedious to code, there was great fulfillment in the struggle.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was important, because it required us to use new concepts. The complexity of creating a known game from scratch through C++ was a challenging, but fun experience overall. The complexity of trying to figure out how to solve certain issues in the code, made the reward THAT much better.

* Lab 3

    I found a lot of motivation coding this lab, as it seemed that were finally able to apply these concepts into something applicable to the real world. Creating functions and being able to calculate prices  for the first time felt great, because I knew that these skills can be used in the real world. Furthermore, the process of creating strategies and execution was fun as well.
